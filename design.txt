can restructure commits into a tree way by still having the version numbers as linear, but can be connected to other versions, so can be

V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, .....

V1 --->V2
   |
   |
   --->V3 --->V4 --->V6
          |
          |
          --->V5

And then do serialize/deserialize of nary tree
